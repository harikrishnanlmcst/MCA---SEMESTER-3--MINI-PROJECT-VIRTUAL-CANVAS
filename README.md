VIRTUAL CANVAS

The “Virtual Canvas” seamlessly integrates Media Pipe’s precise hand tracking with OpenCV's computer vision, resulting in an immersive digital experience. At its core, the system leverages the accuracy of hand tracking technology to detect and interpret intricate hand gestures, translating them into digital commands for drawing, fine-tuning, and manipulating elements on the virtual canvas. 
Users can draw and fine-tune digital elements using intuitive hand gestures, effectively erasing the boundaries between physical and digital art. The user-friendly 
interface provides simple controls for adjusting colures and brushes including eraser. Additionally, image suggestion and generation features are implemented.
